For congressional districts, the Legislature must attempt to pass redistricting plans that attract support from both parties. If this fails, then the task goes to a commission whose members are appointed by politicians. This seven-member commission is made of the Governor, State Auditor, Secretary of State, and one person appointed by each state legislative leader. The only limitation is that members cannot be members of Congress. If the commission fails, then the task goes back to the Legislature. If there is still a lack of bipartisan support, the resulting plan will go into effect for only four years, after which this process will begin again.

For state legislative districts, the same seven-member commission that serves as a backup for drawing congressional districts has the primary responsibility for drawing state legislative maps. The length of time for which the maps are in effect depends on the breakdown for how they are adopted: if at least two commissioners aligned with both parties vote for the maps, they remain in effect for the entire decade. But if the maps are adopted on a party-line vote, they will only be in effect for four years.",,
